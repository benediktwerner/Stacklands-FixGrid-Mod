# Stacklands FixGrid Mod

Adjusts the card alignment grid (when pressing E to align card) so that it always perfectly aligns with the map
meaning you'll never have cards trying to align into the wall and jump around because they can't again.

Specifically, it increases the space between cards in the grid if necessary to make it align.

It also adds configuration options for the minimum size of the grid and by default slightly decreases the minimal horizontal distance between
cards. You can change the configuration via the Mod Manager or by editing the `BepInEx/config/de.benediktwerner.stacklands.FixGrid.cfg` file
which will be generated after starting the game with the mod installed for the first time.
